# CryptoConstellations

As an interactive, Ethereum blockchain based game, CryptoConstellations allows you to have your own Constellations that powered by IPFS technology and each Constellation is a fully decentralized crypto collectible. When you acquire a Constellation you will be the sole owner and your constellation will be immutable forever.

## The Fun (Win) Facts
Just like everything in this universe, your ownership is might not be permanent. If anyone else wants to grab your Constellation, they CAN just by paying up to double the price that you paid. You will then lose the ownership of that Constellation, but you do receive up to double the amount in ETH automatically transferred back to your crypto wallet. Still a win right? Own Constellations, climb up the Leaderboard and become the God of the universe — It’s your call.

## How to Collect Your Own Constellation?
Each available constellation has one smart contract token. When you buy it, you own it, and your ownership will be visible as a card of Constellation on our Leaderboard with the hex color of the six last characters in your wallet address.

The Constellations are visible on the Ethereum blockchain as smart contracts — they can only be acquired using Ether. Each Constellation contract works similarly to a token or a coin and can only be owned by only one individual.

You can take control of any available Constellations in the universe (you can check the availability in the catalog). Anyone else can also purchase and conquer your owned Constellation as long as they pay you the new price calculated from the smart contract after you acquired the Constellation previously.
